# Beat-machine

Beat Machine is a project I worked on during my first semester at Grinnell College in the CSC151 - Functional Problem Solving class.
In this project, I coded a variety of snares, hi-hats, and bass beats through the use of self-programmed accent notes, ghost notes, 
tromellos, etc. Putting these together, I replicated rock, funk, and jazz beats. In the end, I created my own original version of a
bass, snare, and hi-hat beat. The beat machine procedure takes these beats and repeats them n number of times (user specifies n).
